;abstract syntax form:
; (defpat <name>
;     [<docstring>]
;     [<pattern> <clause>]*
;     [<clause>]
; )
;<docstring> := <string>
;<pattern> :=
;  <const> | <var> | <guarded> | (<pattern>*) | (<pattern>* . <pattern>)
;<const> := anything that is: (not a symbol), or (t and nil), or a 'symbol form.
;<var> := anything that is a symbol, but isn't t and isn't nil
;<guarded> :=
;   ,(<var> <test(var)>) | ,@(<test(_)>)
;<test(var)> := an expression involving var; this pattern matches if 
;  this expression returns true for that var
;<clause> := any expression
;
; - like any Arc conditional form, if the last clause doesn't have a
;   pattern, it's the "default" case.
; - You probably want to use (<pattern>*) for the pattern attached to
;   a clause.  If it's a <var>, then it will automatically match anything
;   and everything passed to this function.  If it's a <const>, it will
;   never match, because what is actually passed to a function is a list
;   of its arguments.  Of course, you can use <const> if it's inside
;   a list pattern.
; - () is also nil, so you can match directly to empty lists.
; - list matching is exact; if you put 3 elements, it will match
;   lists with *exactly* 3 elements, never 2 or 4.
; - '<symbol> is defined as a <const>.  This means you can match to
;   a symbol in the argument by using '<symbol>, since <symbol> will
;   match to a variable.  This also means that you should avoid using
;   'quote as a <var>.
; - strings aren't symbols, so they are also defined as <const>
; - also see the tests at the end of this sourcefile.
;
;SUBTLETIES (not bugs!):
; - It's possible to match constants after a dot in a dotted list.
; - If all patterns are lists of the same length, the function
;   will have an exact number of arguments; if all patterns are
;   lists of at least N length, the function will have at least N
;   arguments.
; - (x) <clause> <clause> is slightly different from
;   (x) <clause> dontcare <clause> - the first form will create a
;   function that accepts exactly one argument, the second form will
;   create a function that accepts any number of arguments.
; - (x) <clause1> (y) <clause2> will bind x for <clause1>, and y for
;   <clause2>; however, x will be free in <clause2>, and y will be
;   free in <clause1>.
;
;TODO:
; - 'defpat does not rearrange patterns, so you must manually arrange
;   from most specific to most generic patterns for now.  Obviously it's
;   possible to do this programmatically but I will defer it for now.
; - code cleanup
