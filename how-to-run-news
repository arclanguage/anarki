To run News:

tar xvf arc3.1.tar

cd arc3.1

mkdir arc

echo "myname" > arc/admins

mzscheme -f as.scm

at the arc prompt:

(load "news.arc")

(nsv)

go to http://localhost:8080

click on login, and create an account called myname

you should now be logged in as an admin

manually give at least 10 karma to your initial set of users

don't worry about "user break" messages when restarting News



To customize News:

change the variables at the top of news.arc



To improve performance:

(= static-max-age* 7200)    ; browsers can cache static files for 7200 sec

(declare 'direct-calls t)   ; you promise not to redefine fns as tables

(declare 'explicit-flush t) ; you take responsibility for flushing output
                            ; (all existing news code already does)
