Anarki: a fork of PG's and RTM's Arc Lisp

Anarki is a publically modifiable fork of Paul Graham's and Robert Morris's
project to create a modern lisp for hackers. Anarki is currently forked 
from Arc 3.1 and can run on top of the latest PLT (Racket) Scheme, instead
of the severley out-dated mzscheme 372.

To install:

* `git clone git://git.racket-lang.org/plt`
* Follow the install instructions in `$plt-install-dir/src/README`
* Add `$plt-install-dir/bin/mzscheme` to your `$PATH`
* `git clone git@github.com:nex3/arc.git`
* `cd arc`
* `./arc.sh`
