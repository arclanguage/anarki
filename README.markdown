Anarki: a publicly modifiable 'wiki-like' fork of Arc Lisp (http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html)

The intention is to be extremely permissive in accepting patches. For commit
privileges, just submit your first pull request or ask on http://arclanguage.org/forum.
# Installation
**Warning**: If you are already running a HN-like site, migrating to this fork
might mess up your site's data. Come [talk to us](http://arclanguage.org/forum)
first, and be sure to make a backup before the migration.

To run, install Racket from http://racket-lang.org, then:

    $ git clone http://github.com/arclanguage/anarki
    $ cd anarki
    $ ./arc.sh  # interactive repl
    arc> (quit)
    $
#### Tests:
Anarki has thorough automated tests. To run them, install mercurial, then:

    # start in the anarki directory
    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/zck/unit-test.arc
    $ ./arc.sh
    arc> (load "tests.arc")

Anarki is explicitly not constrained to maintain compatibility with upstream
releases, and compatibility status may swing wildly from commit to commit
depending on who takes an interest. To see a list of what's different, type
`(incompatibilities)` at the repl. If you make an incompatible change, please
update this list.

# Racket interop

**Racket** expressions can be evaluated with the `($ ...)` syntax. For instance, `(($ crypto-random-bytes) 16)` obtains the `crypto-random-bytes` function from **Racket** and makes a call to it.

If you write lots of Racket code and you just want to use Anarki for part of a bigger project, you can `raco pkg install anarki` and use Anarki to write Racket modules:

    #lang anarki
    (:provide function-for-use-in-racket)
    
    (= racket-import ($.dynamic-require ...))
    (load "relative/path.arc")
    
    (def utility-for-use-in-racket (x)
      (* x (racket-import x))

Note that Anarki does not have private module scopes; the `(:provide ...)` section is just there to make it easy to `require` an Anarki-based library from Racket.

## Hacker News Site
anarki comes bundled with a [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) style app.
To run the HN server, first pick your (the admin's) username:

    $ mkdir www
    $ echo __username__ > www/admins

You can have multiple admins. Add them all to www/admins, separated by whitespace.

By clicking on the domain name of a submitted link admins may tag the domain. The color of a domain name indicates its tag:

* *gray* default
* *darkred* ignore
* *darkblue* kill

The HN server will use the `openssl` command. If you're on Windows, first install OpenSSL and make sure it's on your `PATH`. Other systems should be distributed with OpenSSL already.

Now bring up the server:

    $ ./run-news

There'll be a pause while the server loads up, with some messages, then you'll
see the 'arc> ' prompt.

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Click on login, and
create the account for your username. You should now be logged in as an admin.

Don't worry about "user break" or "error writing" messages.

To customize News, change the variables at the top of `lib/news.arc`. To
change the port your server runs at, modify `lib/run-news.arc`.

Any interactive changes to the prompt will be reflected immediately in the
server, without needing to restart it. Don't forget to add them to the .arc
files as appropriate, otherwise they'll be lost when you stop the server or it
dies for some reason.

a simple change to get tests to run.
