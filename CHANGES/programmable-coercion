In vanilla arc, all coercions are hard-coded in ac.scm. Anarki instead bases
coercion on a double hashtable lookup, and exposes the table used to arc as
'coerce*. This allows arc-defined coercions between types. In addition, it adds
coercions to 'fn, which do exactly what you would expect: return a fn that does
what the coerced object would in functional position. Moreover, this
coercion-to-fn is used internally to handle compilation of objects in functional
position, which simplifies matters a good deal and probably improves performance
to boot. See http://arclanguage.org/item?id=9828 for more details.

Specifically, the result of (coerce val new), where val is of type old, is
(((coerce* new) old) val).

Note that changing the value of the variable coerce* itself will *not* affect
coercion. Rather, coerce* is a hashtable which must be _modified_ to affect
coercion. That is:

    ; WRONG
    (= coerce* (let old (copy coerce*) (= old!fn!int (fn (i) (fn _ i)))))
    ; RIGHT
    (= coerce*!fn!int (fn (i) (fn _ i)))

A file load/defcall.arc is also provided which defines 'set-coercer, 'defcoerce,
and 'defcall forms. Examples:

    ; This turns ints into constant functions which return themselves
    (set-coercer 'fn 'int (fn (i) (fn _ i)))
    ; this does the same via 'defcoerce
    (defcoerce fn int (i) (fn _ i))
    ; this does the same via 'defcall
    (defcall int (i . _) i)

Note that unlike anarki-as-of-arc2's 'defcall, the first argument to the
function defined is the object itself, rather than the result of calling 'rep on
the object.
