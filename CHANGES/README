This directory is to be used for documenting changes made relative to official
Arc (most recently Arc 3.1), especially changes to its core functionality,
"hacks" that change or add code in ac.scm (now called ac.rkt), arc.arc, or the
other files that come with Arc. Libraries, in particular, are outside the
scope of this project. Why a directory instead of a single file? Because that
way documentation can be maintained and updated separately for different
changes. Each file in this directory, save this README, should be named after
the hack it documents. Documentation is of course optional, but recommended:
it helps someone browsing the source or version history understand the intent
of the changes made, and it helps newcomers with "feature discovery".
