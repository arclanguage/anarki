Anarki's implementation of 'uniq calls Racket's 'gensym. This has two
effects. First and foremost, 'uniq now returns a "true" gensym - an uninterned
symbol:

    arc> (= s (uniq))
    g1831
    arc> (is s 'g1831)
    nil  ; in Arc 3.1, this would be t

Second, 'uniq takes an optional argument. If present, this argument must be a
symbol or string, and will be used as the prefix for the gensym:

    arc> (uniq 'i-am-a-gensym)
    i-am-a-gensym1833

This is useful for giving gensyms more informative names, which can be helpful
when trying to read macro-generated code.
